        Welcome to the Relief Society Room! Unfortunately, you cannot leave here until some tasks have been completed. Of course, I’m not actually going to lock you in and you can come and go as you please, but try to use a little imagination and at least pretend like you’re stuck here.

              On this web page, you’ll notice several tabs that are labeled: “Piano”, “Emotional Strings”, “Uchtdorf”, “Cards”, and “Missionary”. Once you solve these puzzles around the room, you will input the answers into their respective slots to receive further instruction.

              Please be aware of labels! There are many boxes in the room and for most of them a task needs to be completed before you can open the box.
              You can use the clipboards, pencils, and scratch paper to take notes.
